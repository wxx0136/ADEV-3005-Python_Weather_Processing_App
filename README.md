# Introduction
This is a python application to visualize Winnipegâ€™s historical weather records.

The project uses HTMLParser class to scrape weather data from the Environment Canada website and save them into an SQLite database. I use CLI to interacts with the application and deploy it on a python online compiler for demonstration.
