# Introduction
This is a python application to visualize Winnipegâ€™s historical weather records.

The project uses HTMLParser class to scrape weather data from the [Environment Canada](https://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/daily_data_e.html?StationID=27174&timeframe=2&StartYear=1840&EndYear=2018&Day=1&Year=2018&Month=5) and save them into an SQLite database. I use CLI to interacts with the application and deploy it on a python online compiler for demonstration.
